Welcome to Free Code Camp's first coding challenge!You can edit code in your text editor, which we've embedded into this web page.Do you see the code in your text editor that says <h1>Hello</h1>? That's an HTML element.Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag. Opening tags look like this: <h1>. Closing tags look like this: </h1>. Note that the only difference between opening tags and closing tags is that closing tags have a slash after their opening angle bracket.Once you've completed each challenge, and all its tests are passing, the "Go to my next challenge" button will become enabled. Click it - or press control and enter at the same time - to advance to the next challenge.To enable the "Go to my next challenge" button on this exercise, change your h1 tag's text to say "Hello World" instead of "Hello".
