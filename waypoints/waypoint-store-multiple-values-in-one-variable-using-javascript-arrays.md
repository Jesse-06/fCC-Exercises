####Instructions:
<p class="wrappable negative-10">With JavaScript <code>array</code> variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.</p><p class="wrappable negative-10">You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this: <code>var sandwich = [&quot;peanut butter&quot;, &quot;jelly&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;]</code>.</p><p class="wrappable negative-10">Now let&apos;s create a new array called <code>myArray</code> that contains both a <code>string</code> and a <code>number</code> (in that order).</p><p class="wrappable negative-10">Refer to the commented code in the text editor if you get stuck.</p><div class="negative-bottom-margin-30"><div id="MDN-links"><p class="negative-10">Here are some helpful links:</p></div></div>


####Answer:
```javascript
// var array = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.

var myArray = ["hello", 42];

// Only change code above this line.
// We use this function to show you the value of your variable in your output box.
// You'll learn about functions soon.
(function(z){return z;})(myArray);
