####Instructions:
<p class="wrappable negative-10">Comments are lines of code that your computer will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what it does.</p><p class="wrappable negative-10">Let&apos;s take a look at the two ways you can write comments in JavaScript.</p><p class="wrappable negative-10">The double-slash comment will comment out the remainder of the text on the current line:</p><p class="wrappable negative-10"><code>// This is a comment.</code></p><p class="wrappable negative-10">The slash-star-star-slash comment will comment out everything between the <code>/*</code> and the <code>*/</code> characters:</p><p class="wrappable negative-10"><code>/* This is also a comment */</code></p><p class="wrappable negative-10">Try creating one of each.</p><p class="wrappable negative-10">And one more thing you need to notice. Starting at this waypoint in JavaScript related challenges (except AngularJS, all Ziplines, Git, Node.js and Express.js, MongoDB and Full Stack JavaScript Projects) you can see contents of <code>assert()</code> functions (in some challenges <code>except()</code>, <code>assert.equal()</code> and so on) which are used to test your code. It&apos;s part of these challenges that you are able to see the tests that are running against your code.</p><div class="negative-bottom-margin-30"><div id="MDN-links"><p class="negative-10">Here are some helpful links:</p></div></div>
